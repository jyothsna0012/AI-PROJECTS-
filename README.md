🧑‍⚕️ Disease Predictor with AI

This project is a Machine Learning–based Disease Prediction system built in Google Colab.
It uses the Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle and applies multiple ML techniques for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model.

🚀 Features

📂 Direct Kaggle dataset integration in Google Colab.

🔧 Data preprocessing: cleaning, normalization, splitting.

🤖 Multiple ML models trained and compared.

📊 Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

🏆 Best-performing model saved for reuse.

🔮 AI-powered disease prediction (Heart Disease case study).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Platform: Google Colab

Language: Python

Libraries Used:

pandas, numpy → data processing

scikit-learn → ML models & evaluation

matplotlib, seaborn → visualization

kaggle → dataset download

⚙️ Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection

Used Kaggle’s Heart Disease Dataset (heart_disease_uci.csv).

Downloaded directly in Colab using Kaggle API.

2️⃣ Data Preparation

Handled missing values.

Normalized/encoded features.

Performed train-test split for evaluation.

3️⃣ Model Training

Implemented multiple algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Decision Tree Classifier

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

4️⃣ Evaluation

Compared models using:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Identified the best-performing model.

5️⃣ Optimization & Saving

Applied hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV).

Optimized Random Forest for better performance.

Saved the trained model for future predictions.

📊 Results

Best-performing model: Random Forest Classifier (update with actual result from your notebook).

Achieved XX% accuracy after tuning.

Saved model can be loaded for direct predictions without retraining.

▶️ Running the Project
On Google Colab

Open the notebook: disease_predictor_with_Ai_.ipynb.

Upload kaggle.json (for dataset access).

Run all cells step by step.

Train, evaluate, and save the model.

Use saved model for predictions.

📌 Requirements

If running locally, install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn kaggle

🔮 Future Improvements

Extend dataset to include multiple diseases.

Deploy with Streamlit/Flask for a web-based interface.

Integrate real-time patient input forms.

Use deep learning for advanced prediction
