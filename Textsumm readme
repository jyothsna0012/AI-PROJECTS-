# 🧠 NLP-Based Article Summarization Tool

An AI-powered tool that summarizes lengthy articles using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
This project implements **extractive text summarization** by identifying and ranking the most important sentences from the input text to generate a concise, coalesced summary.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Removes special characters
   - Converts text to lowercase
   - Tokenizes words and sentences
   - Removes stopwords

2. **Word Frequency Calculation**
   - Calculates word importance
   - Normalizes frequencies

3. **Sentence Scoring**
   - Scores sentences based on word frequency

4. **Summary Generation**
   - Selects top-ranked sentences
   - Produces a coalesced summary
